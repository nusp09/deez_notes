# library of bable
la biblioteca de bable - jorge borges
the library of bable is a structure containing books that hold all permutations of our alphabet and 3 symbols, the comma, period and space.
the library is made up of hexagons each with sides filled with books each with a random collection of text. 
there is an inconceivable amount of books and hexagons in the library but there are no repeated books each one is unique.
this leads us to an incredibly interesting place where this library contains all knowledge, all the secrets of man kind, a geneology of all people who have been and who will be, the cure to cancer, shakespear amongst all other things that could ever be written, said or even thought
in jorge borges work he describes mankinds initial elation at the finding of the library, many men dive headfirst into the knowledge that awaits them but they soon find that most of what is down there is of no meaning. some throwing the books down the near endless stairwell and others throwing themselves.
people whisper of a single book that contains references to all other books where to find them and what they are about apparently a cult hides it and defends it, worshiping it like a god, but none of them know if it is truly accurate or is simply misleading them.
